let a: Animal = new Snake("Python");

let a1: Animal = new Horse("Rocket");
let h: Horse = a1;//no explicit casting needed because has same methods and properties (structural type)

let s1: Snake = <Snake> a;//explicit casting needed because Snake has an additional method bite()

let h1 : Horse = new Cat("Kitten");//why is this allowed? Because it has same properties and methods (structural type) not because of inheritance
